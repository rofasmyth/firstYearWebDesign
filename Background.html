<pre style="font-family: constantia ; text-align:center; font-size: 20px ; ">                                               
  The Museum of Free Derry opened in 2007 in order to tell the story of what happened in the city during the period 
  1968 to 1972, popularly known as 'Free Derry', and including the civil rights era, Battle of the Bogside, Internment, 
  Bloody Sunday and Operation Motorman.
  
  The story is told from the point of view of those who were most involved in and affected by these events , the 
  Free Derry community, and the Museum is situated in the heart of where these events took place, in a once-derelict
  housing block in Glenfada Park, in the middle of what was the Bloody Sunday killing zone. Three men were shot 
  and wounded outside this housing block, and two more - William McKinney and Jim Wray - were murdered there. 
  Jim Wray was already lying on the ground, wounded and paralysed by the first burst of fire, when a soldier from 
  the 1st Battalion of the Parachute Regiment shot him twice in the back at point blank range. Poignantly, he died 
  just in front of his grandparents home. The museum's story is told directly by people whose lives were changed by 
  these events.
  
  On Sunday 30 January 1972, as an anti-internment march in Derry drew to an end, British paratroopers attacked the
  marchers, shooting dead 13 unarmed civilians, six of them still legally children, and wounding another 18, one 
  of whom subsequently died. This marked the end of the civil rights campaign in Northern Ireland.
  
  As the Report of the Bloody Sunday Inquiry (widely referred to as the Saville Report) acknowledged, it led directly 
  to a massive upsurge of violence, death and destruction which did not come to an end until the signing of the Good 
  Friday Agreement in 1998.
  
  The Museum of Free Derry exists to remember and understand the local history of the city and its contribution to the 
  ground breaking civil rights struggle which erupted in Derry in the mid-1960s and culminated in the massacre on 
  Bloody Sunday.The histrorical events and tragedys are shown through the Gallerys provided by the free derry museum 
  with posters and images.</pre>
